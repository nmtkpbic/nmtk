Created on 2011-05-12
Updated on 2011-11-09 -- added desrializer support

@author: Daniel Sokolowski

Extends django's built in JSON serializer to support GEOJSON encoding

Requirements:
    Install and setup geodjango (django.contrib.gis)

Install:
    Add ``SERIALIZATION_MODULES = { 'geojson' : 'path.to.geojson_serializer' }`` to your
    project ``settings.py`` file.

Usage:
    from django.core import serializers
    geojson = serializers.serialize("geojson", <Model>.objects.all())

Console Usage:
    python manage.py dumpdata advertisements.advertiserlocation --format geojson --indent 4 --settings=settings_dev > fixture.geojson
         --- check the file and verify that no extra characters were added at top and end of the dump
    python manage.py loaddata fixture.geojson --settings=settings_dev

    **Note:** however using plain JSON serializer/deserializer in the console will work just as fine.
