Your tool server was added to the NMTK server at 
http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{site.domain}}{% url 'nmtk_server_nmtk_index' %}.

The URL of your tool server is {{toolserver.server_url}} 

Your tool server has been given the name "{{toolserver.name}}", and
the tools for the server should be available via the NMTK server very soon.

In order for the NMTK Server and Tool Server to communicate with each other,
the attached file needs to be added to the Tool Server.  In order to do so,
please perform the following sequence of steps:

1.  Transfer the attached file (nmtk_server.config) to your tool server.

2.  Run the management command to import the configuration file:

	python manage.py add_nmtk_server <filename>

Once you have added the configuration file, you should be able to successfully
execute jobs using the NMTK server.
