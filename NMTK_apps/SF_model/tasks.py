    This is where the majority of the work occurs related to this tool.
    The data_file is the input (probably spatial) data.
    The job_setup is a JSON object that contains the job configuration.
    The auth_key is the auth_key as passed by the NMTK server.  It needs
    to be used to pass things like status or results back to the NMTK server as
    the job is processed.

    There's no model (yet) for this particular job - everything happens with the
    uploaded data file.  Later we can store/manage data for the job.

    The assumption here is that all relevant authorization/authentication has
    happened prior to this job being run.
