"<P>This tool implements a predictive model of Pedestrian Volume at Intersections estimated using a Negative Binomial regression method.  The volumes estimated are annual total volumes, and are most suitable for use in a risk exposure model for safety applications.</P>\n<P>The model is based on a combination of environmental and demographic factors that showed a relationship with\nobserved levels of pedestrian activity.  The model uses a simple set of significant environmental and socio-economic\nfactors, and may be applied to areas near urban intersections.</P>\n<P>A team of researchers from the UC Berkeley Safe Transportation Research &amp; Education Center, consultants from Fehr &amp; Peers Transportation Consultants, and staff from the City of San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency developed the coefficients for the model based on locally collected data..  The model implementation\npresented here was developed by the Open Technology Group (Morrisville, NC) under contract with the Federal Highway\nAdministration.</P>\n<P>A paper describing the data and procedures used to develop the model is available in the tool documentation links: Schneider, R.J., T. Henry, M.F. Mitman, L. Stonehill, and J. Koehler. &quot;Development and Application of the San Francisco Pedestrian Intersection Volume Model&quot;, <ital>Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board</ital>, Volume 2299, pp. 65-78, 2012</P>\n",
